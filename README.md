# Hello, everyone! 👩‍💻😺

## ✨About me 
This is Stephanie, AKA Phanie. **I analyze and extract valuable information and insights from Data**.
Despite having a Bachelor's and Master's in Chemical Engineering, I've always wanted to use my analytics and process skills to solve problems from other areas. That's why I chose to study Data Science.
I use **Python** to develop **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and Prediction Projects through **Machine Learning Models**,  and **Power BI** for **Data Visualization Reports**.
Here you may find my projects and study notebooks, as well as links to my Power BI dashboards.

Thanks ;)✨
